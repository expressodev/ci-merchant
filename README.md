# CI-Merchant Library

CI-Merchant is a driver-based payment processing library built specifically for use in CodeIgniter web applications.
It allows you to integrate any supported payment gateway using a consistent API.

## The future of CI-Merchant: [Omnipay](https://github.com/adrianmacneil/omnipay)

CI-Merchant is being rewritten as a PHP 5.3+ Composer package. Not all of the gateways are supported yet,
but if your gateway is supported we recommend using [Omnipay](https://github.com/adrianmacneil/omnipay) instead.

## Requirements

 * CodeIgniter 2.0+
 * PHP 5.2+
